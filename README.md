# mythofblobby
For the 2024 Blueprint competition, we made the game The Myth of Blobby, inspired by the Legend of Zelda.
In this game, the user plays as a blob, exploring a map while collecting coins, fighting enemies, and using power ups. 

We primarily used Unity to create this project.

For the graphics, we wanted to look retro, as our inspiration was the first Zelda game. 
So, for the graphics we drew we used software (such as pixilart) which is intended to create drawings in this 16x16 format.
Additionally, for the background for the menu page, we used Processing to create larger scenes, and then used online tools to give it a pixelated look.

We hope you like the game we have created!
